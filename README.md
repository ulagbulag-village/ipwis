## License

* IPFIS Modules (`ipfis-modules-*`) and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).
* IPFIS Runtime (`/runtime/*` / `ipfis-runtime`) is licensed under [GPL v3.0 with a classpath linking exception](LICENSE-GPL3).

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using IPFIS to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.
